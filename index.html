            Emma’s Big Adventure is a modern reimagining of Jonathan Swift’s classic Gulliver’s Travels. Set in
            Viridelle, a world ruled by talking animals, Emma is the only human and an outsider in her own land.
            Raised by llamas, she embarks on a daring journey to fantastical lands to uncover the mystery of her
            origins. Emma’s journey, from her breathtaking hot air balloon voyage across the Azuri Ocean to her
            encounters with societies both human and animal, echoes Gulliver’s ship voyages, yet brings the spirit of
            exploration to a new, modern medium.

            Accompanied by her animal friends, Newton, an inventive genius, and Edward, a curious biologist, she
            travels to a mysterious island inhabited by tiny human-like creatures. In this island, Emma, instead of
            towering as a giant over the inhabitant - like Gulliver in Lilliput - is perceived as a threat by the tiny beings.

        <p>
            When the island’s Queen is kidnapped, Emma must form unlikely alliances to save her and bring unity to
            Viridelle. A reimagined adventure that blends classic literary echoes with themes of self-discovery,
            friendship, and belonging.
